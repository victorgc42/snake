# Snake using OpenCV (C++).

## INTRODUCTION 

It's a classic arcade game called google snake unless you've been living under a rock the past 30 years you know what I'm talking about when I say google snake and unless you've lived under a boulder the last 30 years you've probably seen this game even if you don't recognize the name the principal of this game is very simple.

You're a google snake and you're crawling around endlessly trying to eat the food while staying away from the walls and staying away from your own ever-expanding tail pretty much all versions of this game and believe me there are plenty have the same principle and the only thing that's advanced is the graphics and the controls nothing else but I'm getting ahead of myself here let's look at where this all began.
